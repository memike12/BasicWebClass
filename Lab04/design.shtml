  <h1> Assigned Reading on Web Design</h1>
</div>

  <p><b>Instructions:</b> Read and consider the three articles described below, answer the questions given, and
  submit your answers using this week's Blackboard 9.1 quiz.  We recommend that you first write your
  answers in a separate text file, then paste them into Blackboard when you are finished.</p>

  <p>The Blackboard quiz has no time limit and you can submit it more than once if
  something goes wrong. <b> You must complete the quiz
  before 0900 on Tuesday</b> </p>

  <!-- List of articles to read and questions to answer -->
  <ul>
     <li>Read <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html">Top
     Ten Mistakes in Web Design</a>.<br/>
     <b>Quiz question: </b> Using your own words, summarize in 1-2
     sentences the one web design mistake discussed in this article
     that you find most annoying or see most often. 
     </li>

     <li>Read <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html">
     Usability 101: Introduction to Usability</a>. <br/>
     <b>Quiz question:</b> Using your own words, summarize in 1-2 sentences
     what you found to be the most important idea in this article.
     </li>

     <li>Edward Tufte has some very interesting ideas on graphical design in general.  Some of his
     ideas are discussed on the web, but I highly recommend his books.  For now, read this
     article describing his <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/9/7/234449/3992">thoughts 
     on web design</a> (at a minium, read until the comments from other users start). <br/>
     <b>Quiz question:</b> Some of Tufte's principles contradict other things you have just read.
     Consider these principles, and take a look at <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte's web
     site</a> to get a feel for a design that embodies them.  In a few sentences describe why you think 
     his ideas work (or why you think they do not).</li>

  </ul>
